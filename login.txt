- Role::truncate(); -> it will delete the data every time you seed

- first you create roles in   RolesTableSeeder  , then you create a user for each role and attach them with each other in   UsersTableSeeder

- make a middleware called   accessMiddleware  , assign it's value in   Kernal.php   , then make a route with this middleware

- show users in Dashboard

- Edit user's roles

- flash Messages

- create fake users with threir roles and truncate table  role_user

- create new provider   BladeExtrasServiceProvider   and use it in   app.blade.php    to hide "manage users" from nonadmin users

- If I wanna delete a user , then it's roles must be deleted either , so I detached them in the    UsersController@destroy   then it will desappear from table
                role_user    , this equals to    onDelete('cascade')

-  Add role when a user registers in    RegisterController
